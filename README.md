# Scientific Calculator with Memory

This is a simple yet powerful scientific calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports basic arithmetic operations, scientific functions, and memory functionality.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Scientific functions: sine, cosine, tangent, logarithm, square root, power, Pi (Ï€), and Euler's number (e).
- Memory functions: store (M+), recall (MR), and clear (MC).
- Supports operations with parentheses.
- Converts degrees to radians for trigonometric functions.

## Getting Started

To use this calculator, follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Save the files as `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Files

- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the calculator.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for the calculator's functionality.

## Code Overview

### HTML

The `index.html` file contains the structure of the calculator, including input fields and buttons for numbers, operations, scientific functions, and memory functions.

### CSS

The `styles.css` file contains styles to make the calculator visually appealing. It uses flexbox and grid layout for alignment and distribution of buttons.

### JavaScript

The `script.js` file contains the core functionality of the calculator, including functions to append characters, calculate results, handle scientific functions, and manage memory operations.

## Example

To perform a trigonometric function like sine, follow these steps:
1. Enter the angle in degrees.
2. Press the "Deg to Rad" button to convert the angle to radians.
3. Press the "sin" button to calculate the sine of the angle.
